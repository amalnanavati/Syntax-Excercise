<p>This exercise has three types of questions. &nbsp;The first type gives you a piece of code, and asks you to use dropdowns to select the correct syntactic elements. &nbsp;The second type gives you a piece of code, and asks you to click on the syntactic elements that are incorrect. &nbsp;And the third gives you two pieces of code that are all the same except for white space, and asks you to determine the functionality of the code.</p>
<p>When you are done with a question, click the "Submit" button in the bottom-right corner. &nbsp;The exercise will then tell you how you did on that question. &nbsp;When you are done reviewing the question, click "Next" (this button will only be visible after you submit) to mvoe on to the next question.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
